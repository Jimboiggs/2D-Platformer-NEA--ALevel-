Scored 73/75

I created a 2D platforming game in the Unity game engine. It contains 5 levels with unique platforms and traps, a start and end screen and a text file which stores information about your playthrough such as the date of completion and time to beat the game/individual levels. One of the most important things I learned was the importance of using local and global variables and keeping C# scripts and subroutines modular.

Alongside the game itself, I also created detailed documentation of each stage of development. It contains:
• Analysis of the 2D platformer genre
• Requirements of my client
• Objectives
• Design of the game
• The code itself
• Testing
• Evaluation

Features and techniques:
• Object-oriented programming
• Stack and list operations
• Recursive algorithms
• Calling APIs and parsing JSON
• Saving to text files
• Merge sort
• Vectors
